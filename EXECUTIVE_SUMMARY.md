# AgentFlow - Executive Summary

## Project Overview

**AgentFlow** is a production-ready framework for building structured agentic workflows using Amazon Bedrock and Claude AI models. This implementation is based on the research paper "AgentFlow: A Framework for Structured Agentic Workflows" (arXiv:2510.05592) and has been completely rewritten to leverage AWS cloud services.

## Cost Considerations

### Model Pricing (Approximate)

- **Claude Sonnet 4**: $3 per million input tokens, $15 per million output tokens
- **Claude Haiku 4.5**: $0.25 per million input tokens, $1.25 per million output tokens

### Cost Optimization

1. **Automatic Model Selection**: Routes simple tasks to Haiku (12x cheaper)
2. **Parallel Execution**: Reduces overall execution time
3. **Token Management**: Configurable max_tokens to control costs
4. **Prompt Optimization**: Concise prompts reduce token usage

### Example Cost Scenario

For 1,000 workflows per day:
- Simple tasks (70%): ~$5-10/day using Haiku
- Complex tasks (30%): ~$20-30/day using Sonnet
- **Total**: ~$25-40/day or ~$750-1,200/month

## Performance Metrics

### Target Performance

- **Workflow Success Rate**: >99%
- **Average Latency (Simple)**: <2 seconds
- **Average Latency (Complex)**: <10 seconds
- **Retry Rate**: <1%
- **Availability**: 99.9%

### Scalability

- **Concurrent Workflows**: 100+ (configurable)
- **Parallel Steps**: 10+ per workflow
- **Throughput**: 1,000+ workflows/hour

## Risk Assessment
