## Migration Guides

### From Original AgentFlow

This implementation uses Amazon Strands SDK and Bedrock instead of the original framework. Key differences:

1. **Model Integration**: Uses Amazon Bedrock instead of direct API calls
2. **Agent Framework**: Built on Strands SDK patterns
3. **Configuration**: YAML and environment variable based
4. **Observability**: CloudWatch-native logging and metrics

Migration steps:
1. Update model configuration to use Bedrock model IDs
2. Adapt agents to new base classes
3. Update workflow definitions to new format
4. Configure AWS credentials and Bedrock access
