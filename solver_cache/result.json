  "query_analysis": "# Query Analysis\n\n## Summary\nThe query asks about the capitals of China since the Qin dynasty (note: \"cpatials\" appears to be a typo for \"capitals\"). This is a historical information retrieval question spanning approximately 2,200+ years of Chinese history.\n\n## Main Objectives\n1. Identify all capital cities of China from the Qin dynasty (221 BCE) to present\n2. Organize this information chronologically by dynasty/period\n\n## Required Skills\n\n**Historical Knowledge Retrieval**\n- Need to access factual historical information about Chinese dynasties and their administrative centers\n- Must trace multiple dynasties (Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing, Republican era, PRC)\n\n**Information Synthesis**\n- Compile data from multiple historical periods\n- Handle complexity of some dynasties having multiple capitals or capital relocations\n\n## Required Tools\n\n**web_search** \u2713 (Available)\n- **How it helps**: Can retrieve comprehensive historical information about Chinese capitals across different dynasties\n- **Usage**: Query for \"capitals of China since Qin dynasty\" or \"Chinese dynasty capitals history\"\n- **Why necessary**: This historical information requires accessing documented sources\n\n**calculator** \u2717 (Not needed)\n- Not relevant for this historical query\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n1. **Query contains typo**: \"cpatials\" should be \"capitals\" - should be interpreted correctly\n2. **Scope clarification**: \"Since Qin dynasty\" implies starting from 221 BCE through present day\n3. **Multiple capitals**: Some dynasties had multiple capitals simultaneously (primary vs. secondary) or moved capitals during their reign\n4. **Definition ambiguity**: Need to determine whether to include regional capitals during periods of division (e.g., Three Kingdoms, Northern/Southern dynasties)",

  "final_output": "# Solution: Capitals of China Since the Qin Dynasty\n\nAlthough the execution history shows placeholder search results, I can provide a comprehensive answer based on historical knowledge about Chinese dynasty capitals.\n\n## Step-by-Step Solution Approach:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\nThe question asks for the capital cities of China starting from the Qin dynasty (221 BCE) through to the present day, spanning over 2,000 years of history.\n\n### Step 2: Chronological Organization\nThe best approach is to organize the information by dynasty in chronological order, identifying the primary capital(s) for each major dynasty.\n\n### Step 3: Comprehensive List of Capitals\n\nHere are the capitals of China since the Qin dynasty:\n\n1. **Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE)**\n   - Capital: **Xianyang** (near modern Xi'an)\n\n2. **Han Dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE)**\n   - Western Han: **Chang'an** (modern Xi'an)\n   - Eastern Han: **Luoyang**\n\n3. **Three Kingdoms Period (220-280 CE)**\n   - Wei: **Luoyang**\n   - Shu: **Chengdu**\n   - Wu: **Jianye** (modern Nanjing)\n\n4. **Jin Dynasty (265-420 CE)**\n   - Western Jin: **Luoyang**\n   - Eastern Jin: **Jiankang** (Nanjing)\n\n5. **Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589 CE)**\n   - Multiple capitals including **Jiankang**, **Luoyang**, and **Chang'an**\n\n6. **Sui Dynasty (581-618 CE)**\n   - **Daxing** (later renamed Chang'an/Xi'an)\n\n7. **Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE)**\n   - Primary: **Chang'an** (Xi'an)\n   - Secondary: **Luoyang**\n\n8. **Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907-960 CE)**\n   - Multiple capitals including **Kaifeng** and **Luoyang**\n\n9. **Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE)**\n   - Northern Song: **Bianjing** (Kaifeng)\n   - Southern Song: **Lin'an** (Hangzhou)\n\n10. **Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368 CE)**\n    - **Dadu** (modern Beijing)\n\n11. **Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 CE)**\n    - Early Ming: **Nanjing** (1368-1421)\n    - Later Ming: **Beijing** (1421-1644)\n\n12. **Qing Dynasty (1644-1912 CE)**\n    - **Beijing**\n\n13. **Republic of China (1912-1949)**\n    - **Beijing** (1912-1928)\n    - **Nanjing** (1928-1949, with interruptions)\n\n14. **People's Republic of China (1949-Present)**\n    - **Beijing**\n\n### Step 4: Key Observations\n\n- **Most frequently used capitals**: Xi'an (Chang'an), Luoyang, Nanjing, and Beijing\n- **Current capital**: Beijing (since 1949 for PRC, and used by multiple previous dynasties)\n- **Geographic shift**: Capitals generally moved from the western regions (Xi'an) to more central and northern locations (Beijing) over time\n\nThis comprehensive list covers all major dynasties and their capitals from the Qin dynasty to the present day.",
