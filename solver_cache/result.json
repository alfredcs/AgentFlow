  "query_analysis": "# Query Analysis\n\n## Summary\nThe query asks about the capitals of China throughout its history since the Qin dynasty (note: \"cpatials\" appears to be a typo for \"capitals\"). This is a historical information retrieval task.\n\n## Main Objectives\n1. Identify all capital cities of China from the Qin dynasty (~221 BCE) to present\n2. Organize this information chronologically by dynasty/period\n\n## Required Skills\n- **Historical knowledge retrieval**: Understanding Chinese dynastic history and political geography\n- **Information synthesis**: Compiling capital cities across multiple dynasties spanning over 2,000 years\n- **Query interpretation**: Recognizing the typo and understanding the historical scope requested\n\n## Required Tools\n\n### From Available Tools:\n- **web_search** \u2713\n  - **How it helps**: Can search for comprehensive lists of Chinese capitals by dynasty, historical records, and verified historical information\n  - **Usage**: Query terms like \"capitals of China by dynasty since Qin\" or \"list of Chinese capitals history\"\n\n### Not Needed:\n- **calculator**: Not relevant for historical information retrieval\n- **code_interpreter**: Not listed as available, but also unnecessary for this straightforward lookup task\n\n## Additional Considerations\n- The query spans a vast time period (2,200+ years), so the response should be organized by dynasty\n- Some dynasties had multiple capitals or relocated capitals\n- Modern China (PRC) vs. historical imperial China distinction may be relevant\n- The typo should be acknowledged but shouldn't impede answering the actual intent",
